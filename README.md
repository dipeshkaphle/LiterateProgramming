# Literate programming in any language

Idea from : [Tsoding: Literate Haskell But in C](https://youtu.be/sSP42LcI15Y)

## Usage

- Name the file as \<filename\>.\<LanguageName\>.md
- Run `dune exec -- lit -i <input md file> -o <output file>`
- Run the file as you would run that particular language
